# To-Do-Application:
A simple to-do application built using Python 3.x.

Technologies Used:
  - Python 3.x

Design Decisions

The design of the To-Do Application was based on simplicity and ease of use. The application uses a while loop and if-elif statements to prompt the user for input and perform the requested action.

Reflection

Working on this project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how to use while loops and if-elif statements in Python. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the application could handle invalid input gracefully. To overcome this, I added a message to prompt the user to try again if they entered an invalid input.
